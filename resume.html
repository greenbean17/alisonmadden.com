    	I'm a 21-year-old born and raised in NYC, taking a break from full-time college to focus on pursuing an education in computer science, gaining work experience, and pursuing my passion for music production. I bring a can-do attitude to any task and I'm always on the look-out for problems to solve. I'm confident in my ability to learn fast, think on my feet, and adapt to a variety of challenges. Looking forward to meeting you and I'm sure we'll get along!
