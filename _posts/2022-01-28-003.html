  <h4>Recounting My Day</h4>
  <h6>I'm gonna stop with that whole date/time/location thing.<br>
  I'm bored so I'm just gonna go over my last day-and-a-half.</h6>

  I woke up at nine-ish yesterday but went on TikTok for like an hour. 
  I played some Valorant, didn't do too well.
  In the afternoon I saw my therapist. We mostly talked about the choice I'm gonna have to make between studying CompSci (safe) 
  and returning to NYU to complete my Recorded Music degree and try to have a career in the music industry (difficult, scary). 
  But honestly, I don't think I'm gonna ever be content if I don't at least try to make the music thing work. 
  The thing is, if (when?) I choose the music route, I'm gonna need to figure out an identity for myself as an artist. 
  As of now, I have no clue what that would be, and I've been thinking about this for years.

  When I got home I watched an absolutely vile episode of anime for me and my friend's podcast about Bakemonogatari. We're talking creepy pedo shit. 
  Don't watch that show, listen to the podcast instead. Anyway, I ended up editing a couple episodes and uploading them. I hadn't uploaded 
  for like three weeks because my previous editing standards were way too high and it was taking too much time. When I got to the third 
  episode I wanted to edit, I learned that I selected the wrong input for my friend's mic, so I only recorded my half of the conversation. 
  I don't really know what to do about that yet. Maybe some sort of short highlights type thing.

  My friend came over at like 8:30 and we quickly got to recording. The episode ended up being kinda short, in part due to me not having the energy 
  to get as angry about the pedo bullshit as I would have liked. I saved the audio and opened Red Dead Redemption 2, which I bought recently and have 
  been enjoying immensely. I played that for the rest of the night, while my friend played Pokemon Go. We got a pizza. It was ok. I kicked my friend 
  out at like 12:30 and went to bed.

  Today I woke up a little after seven because I had to pee, and I decided to get out of bed then. I ended up decing to play some comp games in Valorant 
  because weekday mornings mean few kids are online. I hate playing with kids. Mostly because they tend to get really toxic, but also 
  because I feel uncomfortable talking to kids online in general. I played ok. My friend came on after a couple games and we played a couple more.

  At 11, I was supposed to meet a friend I haven't seen since before the pandemic to paint ceramics, but it snowed and she decided to stay home. I ended up just 
  playing some beat saber and damn, were my arms sore. That Caramelldansen map is a workout. After that I came back to my computer, found that I didn't want to do 
  anything, realized because of that I hadn't taken my second Adderall today, and decided that writing would be the least boring thing to do while I wait on the 
  pill to kick in. So here I am.
