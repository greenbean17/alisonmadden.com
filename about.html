    	I'm a 21-year-old born and raised in NYC, taking a break from college to focus on gaining experience in pro audio and pursuing my passion for music production. I bring a can-do attitude I enjoy solving problems. I'm confident in my ability to learn fast, think on my feet, and adapt to a variety of challenges. Looking forward to meeting you and I'm sure we'll get along!

    	<br>Examples of my Work
  </h4>
  <div>
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/alisonmadden/used-to-be/s-986u0dvMK5K">"Used To Be"</a> [Singer-Songwriter]<br>
    Written and performed by Lily McWhirter. Engineered, produced, and mixed by Alison Madden and Lily McWhirter.<br>
    A lovely tune. The minimal production on this song was a fun departure from the electronic maximalism I'm comfortable with.<br><br>
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/alisonmadden/pissnet/s-UbBwpNExebW">"PissNet"</a> [Hyperpop]<br>
    Written and performed by Alison Madden. Engineered, produced, and mixed by Alison Madden.<br>
    This one's a playful dig at the absurdity of many hyperpop lyrics (100 gecs in particular). It makes no sense and it makes me very happy.<br><br>
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/alisonmadden/starman-soundalike/s-ZGcRVgp406A">"Starman"</a> [Pop]<br>
    Written by David Bowie. Engineered, produced, and mixed by Alison Madden and Brea Fournier.<br>
    This was a project for our production class in which we were tasked with getting as close as we could to the original recording in the limited time given.<br><br>
    My remixes of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/alisonmadden/montero-remix/s-1JzBqgxbgAC">Montero (Call Me By Your Name) by Lil Nas X</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/alisonmadden/the-fire-ali-madden-remix/s-j3UR84qhawd">The Fire by Kayzo and Krankdat</a>
