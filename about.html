    	<br>Profile
  </h4>
  <div>
    	I'm a 21-year-old born and raised in NYC, taking a break from college to focus on gaining work experience and pursuing my passion for music production. I bring a can-do attitude to any situation (within reason) and I enjoy solving problems. I'm confident in my ability to learn fast, think on my feet, and adapt to a variety of challenges. I've interned for TMWRK Management managing artists' schedules and I've helped manage Screen Door Records's web presence and mailing list. I look forward to meeting you and I'm sure we'll get along!
